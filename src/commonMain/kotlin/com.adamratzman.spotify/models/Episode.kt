/**
 * An episode (podcast) on Spotify
 *
 * @param album The album on which the track appears. The album object includes a link in
 * href to full information about the album.
 * @param artists The artists who performed the track. Each artist object includes a link in href
 * to more detailed information about the artist.
 * @property availableMarkets A list of the countries in which the track can be played, identified by their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.
 * @param discNumber The disc number (usually 1 unless the album consists of more than one disc).
 * @param durationMs The track length in milliseconds.
 *
 * @param explicit Whether or not the track has explicit lyrics ( true = yes it does; false = no it does not OR unknown).
 * @param isLocal Whether or not the track is from a local file.
 * @param isPlayable Part of the response when Track Relinking is applied. If true , the track is playable in the
 * given market. Otherwise false.
 * @param name The name of the track.
 * @param popularity The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most
 * popular. The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity
 * is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how
 * recent those plays are. Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity
 * than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album)
 * are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity. Note that
 * the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few days: the value is not updated in real time.
 * @param previewUrl A link to a 30 second preview (MP3 format) of the track. Can be null.
 * @param track Whether this episode is also a track.
 * @param trackNumber The number of the track. If an album has several discs, the track number is the number on the specified disc.
 * @param type The object type: “episode”.
 *
